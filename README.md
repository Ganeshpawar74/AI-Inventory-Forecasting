🚀 Transforming Inventory Management with AI!
Say goodbye to stockouts and overstock headaches. I’ve built an 𝗔𝗜-𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗥𝗲𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 that combines machine learning, predictive analytics, and automation to make inventory smarter, faster, and more reliable.

✨ What it does:
Predicts 14-day demand for each product using LightGBM models
Automatically calculates Reorder Points (ROP) and suggested order quantities
Computes expected costs for smarter planning
Handles missing data and unexpected situations with robust fallback logic

📊 Performance:
On average, the model predicts demand very accurately across categories (R² ≈ 0.89)
Forecasts are only off by about 2–3 units per 14 days on average (MAE ≈ 2.5)
Example per-category accuracy: Beverages 0.933, Dairy 0.904, Snacks 0.955

⚡ Why it’s game-changing:
Automates reorder notifications via n8n
Interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy insights
Reduces overstock, stockouts, and saves operational time
This is AI meeting operations—turning data into actionable decisions and saving time, money, and effort.
